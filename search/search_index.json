Ever since I first got my hands on a device, I\u2019ve been fascinated by how technology works\u2014and yes, even finding ways around parental controls taught me how much I love discovering loopholes.  Over the years, I\u2019ve seen how quickly technology evolves and how hard it can be for people to keep up, especially older adults. I\u2019ve also seen the rise in online scams and the real harm they cause. That\u2019s why I started CyberSafe in the Community\u2014to empower adults with the knowledge and tools they need to protect themselves online.  My goal is simple: help people feel confident using technology so they can stay connected with their families without fear."},{"location":"downloads/","title":"Downloads","text":"<p>Find all presentations and one\u2011page guides here.</p> <ul> <li>Why is Fraud a Problem? \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Recognizing and Preventing Common Scams \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Practical Steps for Protection \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Keeping Devices Updated \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Password Safety and 2FA \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Safe Social Media Use \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Wi-Fi &amp; Home Network Security \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> <li>Key Takeaways for Staying Safe Online \u2014 Presentation (PDF) \u00b7 One\u2011page guide (PDF)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/keeping-devices-updated/","title":"Keeping Devices Updated","text":"<p>Updates fix security flaws.
